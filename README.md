This package provides an MIT license, dependency-free implementation of
Algorithm 1 of "Sinkhorn Divergences for Unbalanced Optimal Transport"
[[SFVTP19](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12958)], which allows calculation of the
optimal transport and Sinkhorn divergence between two positive measures (with
possibly different total mass), where mass creation and destruction is penalized
by one of several possible Ï†-divergences.

See the documentation for a quick tutorial as well as a mathematical description
of the quantities computed by this package.

While the code is generic, it is not currently written to dispatch to BLAS or
non-scalar GPU operations, although such contributions would be welcomed.

This package was motivated by a desire to compare bitmaps corresponding to
printed strings in
[VisualStringDistances.jl](https://github.com/ericphanson/VisualStringDistances.jl).

# Related packages

I found several other Julia implementations of algorithms related to optimal
transport, which may be of interest to the reader. As far as I could find,
however, none are pure-Julia and treat the unbalanced case, which prompted the
creation of this package.
