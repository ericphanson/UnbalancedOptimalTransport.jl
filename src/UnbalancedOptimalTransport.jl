This package provides an MIT license, dependency-free implementation of
Algorithm 1 of "Sinkhorn Divergences for Unbalanced Optimal Transport" [SFVTP19
(http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12958)], which allows calculation of the optimal
transport and Sinkhorn divergence between two positive measures (with possibly
different total mass), where mass creation and destruction is penalized by one
of several possible φ-divergences.
